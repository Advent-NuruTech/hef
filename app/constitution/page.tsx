        <p className="mb-4">
          God calls for evangelists. A true evangelist is a lover of souls. He hunts and fishes for men.
          EV 116.1
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Spirit of Christ is a missionary spirit. The very first impulse of a renewed heart is to bring others also to the savior. GC 70.2 Young evangelists are convicted that God require more of them than merely to preserve the truth in its purity in their own churches; that a solemn responsibility rest upon them to let their light shine forth to those who are in darkness.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Young Evangelist is a group of young Old Seventh Day Adventists who feel called out to announce and prepare a world for the approach of Christ in glory. They commit to firmly advocate ALL gospel reforms in the light of prophecy for &quot;Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things&quot; (Math 17:11, KJV). And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers. (Malachi 4:6). Which simply means taking people(children) back to the faith of the fathers, prophets, apostles, and pioneers.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We have a special commitment to working in harmony with the general body, in proclaiming the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus in the context of the Three Angels&apos; Messages.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          To effectively carry out and represent this solemn work, we&apos;re minded to ourselves be consecrated to the truth. We mean to individually make covenant with God by sacrifice. The Psalmist says, in reference to the last days: &quot;Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-center">
          Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.&quot;
          <br />
          Ps 50:3-5. The Lord will acknowledge as his own such as have sacrificed something for Him. And we know that the Lord requires from us no sacrifice, but such as belongs to our peace. Complete consecration to the work is our watchword. Now unto Him that is able to keep us

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">CHAPTER 2: MISSION, VISION, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</h3>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We, Young Evangelists, recognize the commission of our Lord Jesus Christ to all His
          followers, given in Mathew 28:19-20. We would proclaim this gospel with its attendant
          obligations, &quot;teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you... unto
          the end of the world.&quot; We especially notice the obligations of the gospel because they have
          been especially neglected in our age. Men would have all the privileges of the gospel, but
          none of its requirements. Says the Psalmist in a prophecy for our time: &quot;[It is] time for [thee],
          LORD, to work: [for] they have made void thy law, therefore I love thy commandments
          above gold; yea, above fine gold.&quot; In proportion to the contempt of men towards God&apos;s
          commandments does he love them. We&apos;re bid &quot;Educate! Educate! Educate!&quot;
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In a world where iniquity abounds, and multitudes are daily assailed by Satan to
          destruction, it is our chief joy to preach Christ, the eternal King, who is our consolation, that
          the whole earth may be lighted with His glory.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">MISSION</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          To empower and inspire youth to lead in spreading the gospel with zeal and conviction,
          rooted in Biblical truths and prophecy
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">VISION</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A global movement of youth evangelists actively engaged in revival and reformation in the

        <p className="mb-4">
          To this intent, we have departments which perform various lines of duty.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">CHAPTER 3: DEPARTMENTS CHAPTER</h3>

        <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">3.1: YEM- MUSIC DEPARTMENT</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Singing being as much an act of worship as is prayer is to make people have a close relationship with their Maker. The scripture teaches that we should teach and admonish one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in our hearts unto The Lord. Col 3:16. It is in observance of this injunction that this department exists.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We believe that the world is desperate for solemn, thrilling, cheering, exhorting, soul inspiring songs; therefore, it is also our object to bring decided reforms in music.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Our chief aim being, &quot;to do all for the glory of God&quot;, 1 Cor 10:31, it is our hope that by giving heed to all spiritual guidance in regard to this, the Lord will grant us success. We therefore refuse the use of percussion instruments such as the Tophet/Drum, and any kind of beats which have the drum.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We refuse to incorporate any styles used in the world&apos;s music industry in the cause of Christ.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          It is not our purpose to learn and sing songs which may strengthen the lower nature and lead to dancing, for this will fail to inspire the souls to appreciate the things unseen. We advocate the skillful use of stringed instruments, should there be, because they are in keeping with the Spirit of Divine worship. The reason is that they blend well with the human voice.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">CHAPTER 3.2: YEM- PUBLIC EVANGELISM DEPARTMENT</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This department is responsible for bible studies, preaching in open air, during outreaches, to prepare the world for the coming of Christ. They present the key fundamental principles of the faith we profess.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Some of the subjects handled are: Health, family life, Bible study, Sermon and prophecy- to do the work akin to that of Prophet Elijah namely: to return the hearts of the people to their God.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">CHAPTER 3.3: HEALTH MINISTRY AND MEDICAL MISSIONARY DEPARTMENT</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As God&apos;s people, we understand that we are not our own. We therefore choose to live in reference to health principles.Having convicted that the laws of health(physical laws) are binding are ten commandments and breaking them is as much as breaking the ten commandments. We are convicted to treat our own bodies with dignity to the glory of God. We would eat, drink, dress and work in harmony with the laws of our being and all to glorify God.

        <div className="text-right mb-4">4</div>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          This department is therefore concerned with:
        </p>

        <ol className="list-decimal ml-8 mb-4">
          <li>Educating group members, the brethren in the faith and the general public on the right and sure principles of health reform.</li>
          <li>Conducting medical missionary training for members, for the brethren in the faith and for the general public. This is to cover the treatment of disease through hygienic and rational agencies.</li>
          <li>To conduct efforts and programs for the actual treatment of disease through the said methods.</li>
        </ol>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We would use the harmless methods of preventing and reversing disease that have been advocated by our faith for some time. Let us present our bodies as living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which is our reasonable service.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">CHAPTER 3.4 CHURCH MINISTRY DEPARTMENT</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 italic">
          Says the Scripture: &quot;And He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 italic">
          That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into Him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: From whom the whole body fifty joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.&quot; Eph 4:11-16, KJV.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In the light of these texts, no Christian is excusable for receiving without giving. Every branch of the Living Vine has a duty to bear fruits, no less than to draw nutrition from the Vine. A member of the &quot;body of Christ&quot; will be blessed by the body and in turn they will bless. In any case, &quot;It is more blessed to give than to receive,&quot; Acts 20:35.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The disciples of old were instructed to begin their work at Jerusalem. The ministry is determined, in the strength of Christ, to do no differently so that the church may go forth (presenting a united front) &quot;fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners.&quot; The Song of Solomon 6:10.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          This department is called a &quot;ministry&quot; because it is ministers. It serves. It organizes missions to our churches.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          It also gives every member opportunity to minister as per the gift given by the spirit of God
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">CHAPTER 3.5: LITERATURE EVANGELISM DEPARTMENT</h4>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Old Seventh Day Adventist church has historically maintained great esteem for
          literature evangelism as a vital gospel tool. The responsibilities comprehended in this
          department, therefore, include:
        </p>

        <ol className="list-decimal ml-8 mb-4">
          <li>To promote literature evangelism and to present God-given incentives for doing the work.</li>
          <li>To assert and demonstrate the circulation of pure present truth gospel literature, upholding the integrity of true literature evangelism. This is with keen knowledge of the present encumbrances to the dignity and purity of the work:</li>
        </ol>

        <p className="mb-4 italic">
          &quot;My heart aches as I see men—even those who profess to be looking for Christ&apos;s coming, —
          devoting their time and talents to circulating books that contain nothing concerning the
          special truths for our time, —books of narrative, books of biography, books of men&apos;s theories
          and speculations. The world is full of such books; they can be had anywhere; but can the
          followers of Christ engage in so common a work when there is crying need for God&apos;s truth
          on every hand? It is not our mission to circulate such works. There are thousands of others to
          do this, who have as yet no knowledge of anything better. We have a definite mission, and
          we ought not to turn from it to side issues, employing men and means to bring to the
          attention of the people books that have no bearing upon the present truth 118.2.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Here, as elsewhere, there is need of going back to the old paths. Jeremiah 6:16. This will
          mean discarding and burning all the books of new order.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">CHAPTER 3.6: PUBLISHING DEPARTMENT</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In close connection to literature evangelism, is the publishing work. This department deals
          with the actual production and publication of literature.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Beside literature, publishing department is in charge of the production and publication of
          electronic information or information through any other channel, should there be. The Bible
          says of the latter days: &quot;Knowledge shall be increased.&quot; We mean to make use of
          knowledge in all lines to prosper the work of Him from whom all good gifts flow.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">CHAPTER 3.7: EDUCATION DEPARTMENT</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This department seeks to uphold true education which means more than the pursual of a
          certain course of study. It means more than a preparation for the life that now is. It is has to
          do with the whole being, and the whole period of existence possible to man. &quot;It is the
          harmonious development of the physical, the mental and the spiritual powers &quot;. It prepares
          the student for the joy of service in this word and for the higher joy of wider service in the
          world to come. ED13.1

        <p className="mb-4 italic">
          &quot;The early reformers found it necessary to have their own courses of study, textbooks, teachers, methods and principles. They separated themselves from popular schools of the day &quot; PH081 37.2. Going by this word we advocate for independent education systems based on biblical truths and free from papal influence

          &quot;If their children should go to the schools where the popular education was given, they would receive the mark of the papacy, or the beast .PH081 37.2. Thus, this department emphasizes total separation from Babylon and seeks to restore the old form of education in Adventism. It requires much courage and faith for those who are preparing for translation to take this stand.

        <p className="mb-4">
          This department is responsible for expediting this work.

          Young Evangelist, being a ministry, embraces all the counsels given in the Bible as well as the Spirit of Prophecy in regard to dress and adornment. Among these are some herein specified:

            1 Peter 3:3-4- &quot;Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel. But let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.&quot;
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            1 Timothy 2:9- &quot;In like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety, not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array but (which become women professing Godliness) with good works.&quot;
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            Leviticus 19:27- &quot;You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you mar the corners of thy beards.&quot;

            1 Cor 11:3-7- &quot;But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God. Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered dishonoureth his head, but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head, for that is even all one as if she were shaven. But if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man.&quot;

They sacrifice time and money, the vigor of intellect, and true elevation of soul, and devote their entire being to the claims of fashionable life...A disposition in you to dress according to the fashion, and to

          their presence marked on the group register. Those who previously lost membership by
          any means (including absence) will renew it only after approval of members. If membership
          was lost on the basis of issues of discipline, then it should be renewed only after the member

          Respect and the spirit of submission should be embraced. Willfulness and pride tend to ruin.

          Like church discipline, discipline in the group is to be asserted in strict compliance with the
          rule of Christ as highlighted in the eighteenth chapter of the book of Mathew.

        <p className="mb-4 italic">
          &quot;In dealing with erring church members, God&apos;s people are carefully to follow the
          instruction given by the Saviour in the eighteenth chapter of Matthew...

        <p className="mb-4 italic">
          Church members have no right to follow their own impulses and inclinations in dealing with
          fellow members who have erred. They should not even express their prejudices regarding
          the erring, for thus they place in other minds the leaven of evil...

          &quot;If thy brother shall trespass against thee,&quot; Christ declared, &quot;go and tell him his fault
          between thee and him alone.&quot; Matthew 18:15. Do not tell others of the wrong. One person is
          told, then another, and still another; and continually the report grows, and the evil increases,
          till the whole church is made to suffer. Settle the matter &quot;between thee and him alone.&quot; This
          is God&apos;s plan.... Do not suffer sin upon your brother; but do not expose him, and thus

        <h5 className="font-bold mb-2">Preamble</h5>
        <p className="mb-4">
          It should be noted that every time a member violates the principles of our constitution; which is what keeps us united, they become a discordant note; casting broadcast an unsavory influence in the group and beyond. By thus doing violence to the principles of the constitution to which they had pledged allegiance while joining the group, the member justly forfeits membership. The processes/procedure detailed below should therefore not be understood as an entitlement to the offending member (by which expeditious and necessary action by the leadership/membership is debarred), but as a demonstration of essential Christian kindness to erring members. On the one hand, the members should make it a rule to not stint themselves of right doing, considering how far they can go in wrong, while still remaining inculpable. We must not be sparing/ungenerous in right doing; being afraid of doing right too much. We are not to try to see how much we can circumvent the letter of the constitution, but how far we should be in harmony with its spirit. The leaders, on the other hand, should make it a strict rule to act in kindness to even erring members. Wrongs, however grievous, should be honorably overlooked if there is an attitude of repentance and a determination to overcome. Willful wrongs are intolerable.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          All matters considered, both leaders and members must beware of the &quot;tender mercies of the wicked&quot; which &quot;are cruel&quot; Pro. 12:10, Margin. We must avoid the false sympathies to erring members which do not only strengthen their hands in wrong (thus doing injury to these souls), but which would also tend to weaken the hands of the leaders/members in enforcing right.

        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          I. II. Any member who notices a wrong course of action in another is duty bound to approach them and help them to recover themselves to the right course of action. Should all efforts fail, they should report the matter to the leadership; viz. the chapter Chairperson for the chapters and the coordinator, for the general group.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          II. At this point, the chapter Chairperson or the General Coordinator is duty bound to act. A leader who proves too indolent or cowardly to act in the face of wrongs that violate the principles of our constitution commit an impeachable offence. Any member who acts contrary to the Christian Principles as outlined in the constitution will face disciplinary actions as follows
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          a). Lose membership until they show a change of heart and be willing to be in harmony with the principles outlined in the Bible and our Constitution. They shall be accepted back as members in the next AGM should they demonstrate a change of mind and make amends. The acceptance should be on the basis of signing a new commitment form to be accepted during our AGM.

        <p className="mb-4">
          b). To lose membership, the Chairperson/ Coordinator/Secretary shall discuss the intentions with the erring member and exploit all possibilities of recovering them. If all else fails, the action of removing them from our platforms should be taken (including from our registers) in consultation with (so far as is possible and proper) the leadership in office. This may be done by communicating the intention on the wall of the leaders (without improperly getting to details) some moment before action. For very sensitive cases, it may simply be sufficient to engage a few leaders on the sides. This can enable individual members of the leadership team to engage the erring member with the intention to restore them. Nothing at all should be discussed at this stage on whether or not a member should be accommodated in the group while still in their error.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Nothing about changing the constitution to accommodate the erring member. This engagement should be treated as simply a matter of accountability and transparency. Under no circumstance should a leader undertake the responsibility upon themselves to undertake the above action(s) to settle personal quarrels
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          c). The erring member will then be requested to leave the online group. Otherwise, the secretary will (or any of the three online group admins; Chairperson/Coordinator/Secretary) remove the name from the online group and the secretary will remove it from the YEM register.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          d). Any member or leader who by word or action supports an erring member in their compromise will also lose membership and leadership automatically. This will be treated as an act of subversion, by the leader/member, of the interests of the group.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          e). The executive through the chair shall update the rest of the members during the annual general meeting of the actions taken on erring members. This will ensure transparency in handling the erring.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          B. For Personal Differences
          All the processes in their literal sense Highlighted in Matthew 18:15-17 should be followed. Because personal differences are complicated in their detail, there should be all the transparency possible. At the Chapter level, the Chapter leaders may enforce discipline in these respects as well, though in these cases, the final verdict should come from a joint meeting at the chapter level. For members who belong to no organized Chapter, this mandate should come from any joint YEM meeting. In all cases of action taken in regard to discipline, a communication should be made in the AGM for transparency.
          NOTE No member should feel insecure because of the existence of guiding rules or disciplinary procedures. We should rather treat these as guardrails for our unity, peace and temporal (and eternal) good.

The hair is strained and forced into unnatural positions, and it is not possible for the heads of these fashionable ladies to be comfortable. The artificial hair and pads covering the base of the brain, heat and excite the spinal nerves centering in the brain. The head should ever be kept cool. The heat caused by these artificial induces the blood to the brain. The action of the blood upon the lower or animal organs of the brain, causes unnatural activity, tends to recklessness in morals, and the mind and heart is in danger of being corrupted. As the animal organs are excited and strengthened, the moral is enfeebled. The moral and intellectual powers of the mind become servants to the animal. {`{HR, October 1, 1871 par. 9}`} In consequence of the brain being congested its nerves lose their healthy action, and take on morbid conditions, making it almost impossible to arouse the moral sensibilities.

          <li>By braiding/plaiting we mean what the English definitions above indicate. We don&apos;t only object to additions to the hair, but to braiding; even in its more subtle forms.</li>
          <li>We maintain that the above principles should be observed by members in personal life as well as during active ministry. Our principles do not only apply while we are in active mission.</li>
          <li>Our influence counts. A wrong influence in this respect as well as in others decidedly warrants disciplinary action.</li>
